            <Text text="When the application detects that you are in a League of Legends Champion Select, it will automatically mirror the draft. This means that as champions are picked and banned in your game client, they will appear in the 'Game' tab of League Assistant FX. This feature is designed to provide real-time recommendations and insights without manual input, allowing you to focus on your game."/>

            <Text text="You can also manually input picks and bans in the 'Game' tab if you are not in a live Champion Select, or if you wish to simulate a draft. Simply click on an empty champion slot (pick or ban) and then select a champion from the recommendations list on the right. You can also right-click a champion to clear a slot. This is useful for practicing drafts, testing team compositions, or reviewing past games."/>

However, for off-meta picks or specific strategies, you can manually adjust the assigned role by clicking on the role icon next to the champion. This ensures that recommendations are tailored to your team's actual composition."/>
